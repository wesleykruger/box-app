# Box content explorer

Experimental project to use Box's APIs to connect to an enterprise file explorer. Requires a Box developer account and a Box business account (you can get a trial for these on their site) to use. You will need to use your own tokens and IDs.

Once your keys and permissions are set, you will be able to browse the contents of your enterprise Box storage.
